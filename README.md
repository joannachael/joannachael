## About me
* I'm a backend developer from **Ukraine** 🇺🇦
* My main language is **Python** 🐍
* I'm fond of **Rust**. I believe that one day this language will become much   
  more popular thanks to its **graceful avoidance of the main problems of all software** 👏
* I would like to participate in the development of projects of different complexity,  
  communicate with more experienced programmers 🆙
* Ultimately, I would like to conduct social and educational activities related to our science 👨‍💻

## My contacts
* You can always connect with me via [Telegram](https://t.me/whojoannaami)! 📲
